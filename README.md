# HUTrader

This is a web application to facilitate conversation and manage reputation around trading in-game assets in EA Sports NHL's game mode Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT).

[This is the official website for some background information on HUT.](https://www.easports.com/nhl/hockey-ultimate-team/ultimate-guide)

For this application I am using ruby version 2.2.2 and rails version 4.2.3. It is deployed on heroku at https://sleepy-bayou-2110.herokuapp.com/. I am currently using [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) for the front end design, but will modify it in a coming PR.

Model and Controller tests can be run with

```
bundle exec rake test
```
and tests for views can be run with

```
bundle exec rake cucumber
```

lol I used cucumber
